### Technical

- You are tasked with designing (database) and creating a backend service in **Spring Boot**
- Make sure your code adheres to the best programming practices
- You will use **Postgres Database** and run it inside Docker using **Docker Compose** file
- To configure the application, it is recommended to use the **'application.yml'** file instead of 'application.properties'. This YAML-based configuration file allows for a more readable and organized approach to managing application properties.
- As a build tool, use **Gradle** instead of Maven.
- For confidential information inside application.yml (database credentials, ...) use **environment variables**
